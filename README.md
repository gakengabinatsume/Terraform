# Terraform
**Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage, in a declarative manner. With Terraform, you can describe your desired infrastructure configuration using a simple and human-readable language, called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or JSON. Terraform then automates the process of creating and managing these resources across various cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. It helps streamline the deployment and management of infrastructure, making it easier to scale and maintain your applications.**

**Terraform provides a set of commands that you can use to interact with and manage your infrastructure. Here are some commonly used Terraform commands:**

1. `terraform init`: Initializes a Terraform working directory by downloading and configuring the necessary providers and modules.

2. `terraform plan`: Generates an execution plan that shows what actions Terraform will take to create, modify, or delete resources. It helps you preview the changes before applying them.

3. `terraform apply`: Applies the changes defined in your Terraform configuration to create or modify the infrastructure resources. It prompts for confirmation before making any changes.

4. `terraform destroy`: Destroys the infrastructure resources created by Terraform, effectively tearing down the infrastructure.

5. `terraform validate`: Validates the syntax and configuration of your Terraform files, ensuring they are properly formatted and free of errors.

6. `terraform state`: Allows you to manage the Terraform state, which is a record of the resources created and managed by Terraform.

**These are just a few examples of the commands available in Terraform. You can explore more commands and their functionalities in the Terraform [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands).**
